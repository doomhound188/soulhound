# Audio Streaming Fixes - SoulHound Bot

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Infinite Loop Problem (Critical Fix)**
**Problem:** Bot was stuck in an endless retry loop trying to stream mock Spotify URLs, causing EOF errors repeatedly.

**Solution:**
- Added retry limits (max 3 attempts) with exponential backoff
- Implemented proper error handling to skip failed tracks
- Added detection for mock URLs to avoid unnecessary retries
- Enhanced logging to track streaming attempts and failures

### 2. **Mock Audio Streaming**
**Problem:** Mock URLs (like `spotify_mock_*`) were being treated as real URLs and failing.

**Solution:**
- Added proper detection for mock URLs (both `mock_*` and `spotify_mock_*`)
- Implemented `streamTestAudio()` function that creates actual test audio (silence)
- Mock tracks now play successfully for testing purposes

### 3. **YouTube Audio Streaming Improvements**
**Problem:** YouTube streaming was unreliable and had poor error handling.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced YouTube provider with better format selection
- Prefer audio-only formats (webm) for better Discord compatibility
- Added detailed error messages suggesting yt-dlp for better support
- Improved logging for YouTube stream URL acquisition

### 4. **Spotify Handling**
**Problem:** Spotify was returning mock data but users weren't informed about limitations.

**Solution:**
- Added clear messaging that Spotify direct streaming isn't supported
- Improved mock data handling for testing
- Better error messages explaining Spotify limitations

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling & User Experience**
**New Features:**
- Added comprehensive `!test` command for bot functionality testing
- Enhanced logging throughout the audio pipeline
- Better error messages explaining what went wrong
- Graceful degradation when audio sources fail

## Key Improvements

### **Retry Logic with Circuit Breaker**
```go
maxRetries := 3
retryCount := 0

for retryCount < maxRetries {
    if err := b.streamAudio(streamURL, vc); err != nil {
        retryCount++
        
        // Skip retries for mock tracks
        if strings.HasPrefix(streamURL, "spotify_mock_") || strings.HasPrefix(streamURL, "mock_") {
            break
        }
        
        // Exponential backoff
        if retryCount < maxRetries {
            waitTime := time.Duration(retryCount) * time.Second
            time.Sleep(waitTime)
        }
    } else {
        streamingSuccessful = true
        break
    }
}
```

### **Mock Audio Testing**
```go
func (b *Bot) streamTestAudio(vc *VoiceConnection) error {
    // Creates 2 seconds of silence for testing voice connections
    vc.connection.Speaking(true)
    defer vc.connection.Speaking(false)
    
    // Send silence data in 20ms chunks
    silenceFrames := 48000 * 2 * 2 // 2 seconds
    silenceData := make([]byte, silenceFrames)
    // ... streaming logic
}
```

### **Enhanced YouTube Support**
- Better format detection and selection
- Preference for audio-only formats
- Detailed error messages with yt-dlp suggestions
- Improved compatibility with Discord's audio requirements

### **Comprehensive Testing Command**
New `!test` command provides:
- Bot connectivity verification
- Voice channel connection testing
- Audio provider functionality testing
- Queue system verification
- Mock audio streaming test
- Configuration validation

## Usage Instructions

### **For Testing:**
1. Join a voice channel
2. Run `!test` to verify all functionality
3. Try `!play test` to test actual playback with mock audio

### **For Real Usage:**
1. **YouTube:** Works with current implementation, but yt-dlp recommended for better reliability
2. **Spotify:** Only search/metadata supported - direct streaming not possible due to licensing

### **Troubleshooting:**
- Use `!debug` for voice channel diagnostics
- Use `!voicetest` to check voice state detection
- Use `!apitest` to verify Discord API connectivity
- Use `!diagnose` for comprehensive guild analysis

## Technical Notes

### **Mock URL Detection:**
- `mock_*` - General mock URLs
- `spotify_mock_*` - Spotify mock URLs
- Both are handled by `streamTestAudio()` instead of failing

### **Error Recovery:**
- Failed tracks are automatically skipped
- Queue continues to next track on streaming failure
- No more infinite retry loops

### **Logging Improvements:**
- Detailed streaming attempt logging
- Clear error messages for different failure types
- Success/failure tracking for debugging

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **Install yt-dlp** for better YouTube support:
   ```bash
   pip install yt-dlp
   ```

2. **Implement yt-dlp integration** for reliable YouTube streaming

3. **Add Spotify Web API** for search functionality (metadata only)

4. **Implement YouTube fallback** for Spotify tracks (search YouTube for Spotify song titles)

The bot now handles audio streaming failures gracefully and provides comprehensive testing tools for debugging issues.
